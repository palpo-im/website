# Palpo Installation and Deployment

This document provides detailed instructions for building the Palpo Matrix server on different platforms.

The Palpo runtime only requires a PostgreSQL database, the Palpo executable file, and a corresponding configuration file `palpo.toml`.

If you are installing and deploying via Docker, you can skip the introduction to PostgreSQL database installation.
