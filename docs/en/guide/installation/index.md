# Palpo Installation and Deployment

This document provides detailed instructions for building the Palpo Matrix server on different platforms.

Palpo only requires a PostgreSQL database, the palpo executable, and a corresponding configuration file, `palpo.toml`.

If you are deploying via Docker, you can skip the PostgreSQL database installation instructions.
